- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Charles-Lillywhite, a recent Physics MPhys graduate from Durham University.

- ðŸ‘¾ I have 4 years experience coding in Python; as part of my degree I used Python to execute a broad range of mathematical 
     and statistical operations including numerical integration, vector algebra, stochastic simulations, and plenty of cool graph plotting!
     
- ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ’µ My master's project made extensize use of Python to simulate the quantum mechanical technique of *reverse annealing*, and how this can be used to
 optimise the returns of simple investment portfolios. 
 
- ðŸ¤– My recent personal projects include a simple web application, and an automated email bot

- ðŸ§© Here you can find examples of the code I have written, as well as some of the research documents I have produced.
